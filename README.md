# About This Project
The goal of this project was to create a Python script, using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3), that automatically shutsdown EC2 instances by integrating the script into a Lambda function.

# What's In The Repo?
This repo contains multiple python scripts that shutsdown EC2 instances however, they all do it differently..
